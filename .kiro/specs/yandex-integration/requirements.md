# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Yandex reverse image search integration to the existing image leak detection system to improve search accuracy and ensure more reliable detection of image usage across the web. The current system relies primarily on Google Vision API, but adding Yandex's powerful reverse image search capabilities will provide broader coverage and higher accuracy for detecting unauthorized image usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user uploading images for leak detection, I want the system to use multiple search engines including Yandex, so that I can get more comprehensive and accurate results about where my images are being used online.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL perform reverse image search using both Google Vision API and Yandex reverse image search
2. WHEN Yandex search is performed THEN the system SHALL return structured results with URLs, confidence scores, and search metadata
3. WHEN both search engines return results THEN the system SHALL merge and deduplicate the results intelligently
4. WHEN Yandex API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to Google Vision API only and log the failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Yandex API credentials securely, so that the integration works reliably without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL check for Yandex API credentials in environment variables
2. WHEN Yandex credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL log a warning but continue operating with Google Vision API only
3. WHEN Yandex credentials are present THEN the system SHALL validate them during startup
4. WHEN invalid credentials are detected THEN the system SHALL log an error and disable Yandex integration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reviewing search results, I want to see which search engine found each result, so that I can understand the source and reliability of the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed THEN each result SHALL include metadata indicating whether it was found by Google, Yandex, or both
2. WHEN a result is found by multiple engines THEN the system SHALL indicate this and show the highest confidence score
3. WHEN results are merged THEN the system SHALL preserve the original search method information for each URL
4. WHEN displaying search statistics THEN the system SHALL show counts for each search engine used

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want Yandex integration to be implemented with proper error handling and logging, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Yandex API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including status codes and error messages
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
3. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and continue with available search engines
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs of API requests and responses (excluding sensitive data)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user concerned about performance, I want Yandex integration to not significantly slow down the search process, so that I can get results in a reasonable time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both search engines are used THEN they SHALL be called in parallel to minimize total search time
2. WHEN one search engine is slower than expected THEN the system SHALL not wait indefinitely and SHALL return partial results if needed
3. WHEN search performance is measured THEN the total time SHALL not exceed 30 seconds for normal operations
4. WHEN timeout limits are reached THEN the system SHALL return results from completed searches and log the timeout

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user analyzing search results, I want to see improved accuracy and coverage compared to using Google Vision API alone, so that I can have confidence in the completeness of the leak detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing results THEN Yandex integration SHALL provide additional unique URLs not found by Google Vision API
2. WHEN duplicate URLs are found by both engines THEN the system SHALL use the higher confidence score
3. WHEN search quality is evaluated THEN the combined results SHALL show measurably better coverage than single-engine searches
4. WHEN false positives are detected THEN the system SHALL use cross-validation between engines to improve accuracy
